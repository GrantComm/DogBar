## Getting started

You will need to install Node.js and Flutter on your machine.

### Node.js Setup
For best results, use [Node.js 16 or higher](https://nodejs.org/).

You can check your current version of Node.js with

```sh
$ node --version
v16.17.0
```

Then, inside this project, run

```sh
npm install
node server.js
```

If the server starts successfully, you will see

```sh
Server running on http://localhost:3011
```

in the terminal.

### Flutter Setup
First, install the Flutter SDK and add the flutter tool to your path.

Then run

```
flutter doctor
```

to make sure flutter is installed and in your path.

For more specific installation and setup, view https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install

## Running the project
To run the application, run

```
 ./run.sh
```

and a chrome window should open with the application running (It may take a short amount of time to load).
